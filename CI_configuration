1. Download CI framework
Download link: https://codeigniter.com/download 

2. Extract and copy the CI Core files to your htdocs folder.

3. Open browser and go to http://localhost/<your application folder name inside htdocs directory>
	You should see a default CI  welcome page.

4. Start your own application development. Start by editing config
i) application/config/autoload.php
	a) $autoload['libraries'] = array('database', 'session');
	b) $autoload['helper'] = array('url');
ii) application/config/config.php
	a) $config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost/<your application folder name>/';
iii) application/config/database.php
	a) configure your own database, change hostname, username, password, dbname
iv) application/config.routes.php
	a) $route['default_controller'] = 'Home';
	This is the Controller name which will be loaded as default. In above case, we will need a Controller class Home.php inside
	application/controllers/Home.php

Optional:
With above configuration, the page URL will be something like this in every other pages than base_url (refer to above point 4-ii for base_url)
http://localhost/myapplication/index.php/other-page-url

If we want to remove index.php from above url sample, we will need to configure this as below:
application/config/config.php
set value as below
$config['index_page'] = '';

create a file named as .htaccess inside root folder of your application (e.g. htdocs/myapplication/.htaccess)
paste the following lines

#########################################################################################################
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /myapplication/

    #Removes access to the system folder by users.
    #Additionally this will allow you to create a System.php controller,
    #previously this would not have been possible.
    #'system' can be replaced if you have renamed your system folder.
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^system.*
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [L]
    
    #When your application folder isn't in the system folder
    #This snippet prevents user access to the application folder
    #Submitted by: Fabdrol
    #Rename 'application' to your applications folder name.
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^application.*
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [L]

    #Checks to see if the user is attempting to access a valid file,
    #such as an image or css document, if this isn't true it sends the
    #request to index.php
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]
</IfModule>

<IfModule !mod_rewrite.c>
    # If we don't have mod_rewrite installed, all 404's
    # can be sent to index.php, and everything works as normal.
    # Submitted by: ElliotHaughin

    ErrorDocument 404 /index.php
</IfModule>

update RewriteBase with your application folder name.

go to your url now without index.php in between of it.

http://localhost/myapplication/Home
